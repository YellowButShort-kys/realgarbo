You are free to do anything you want with these characters. I do not endorse any sort of censorship. Just have fun!
Every message costs tokens, you gain them with a free daily bonus, or by buying them either as subscription (better value for your money) or as a separate purchase.
If you encounter anything weird, or have a cool idea, feel free to write to our customer support (https://t.me/CarpAISupportBot)

It's simple. Normal text is speech, everything that is encapsulated in asterisks are actions.]]
