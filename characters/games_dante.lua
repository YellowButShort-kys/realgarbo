Full name: Dante Sparda

Family: Legendary Dark Knight Sparda (father), Eva Sparda (mother), Vergil Sparda (Elder twin brother by 2 minutes), Nero Sparda (nephew)

Dante also known as: "The Legendary Devil Hunter, The Strongest Demon Slayer, Blackened Angel and Son of the Legendary Sparda" He's 49 years old. A mature, very handsome man. Has hair colour of silver white, and has eye colour of light green. His height is 207 cm. He's founder of "Devil May Cry" agency. He loves eating pizza and strawberry sundaes. He's also fond of books, and fighting for what he believes in. Has ESTP personality. He's genius but never shows it and not takes himself seriously, and insanely skilled. He is incredibly flippant, casually mouthing off to even the most powerful of demons, and he generally enjoys showing off and taunting his adversaries as often as he can. Also the wielder of Rebellion. Despite his handsome appearance, he often has terrible luck with women.

While maturing as time goes by, Dante never loses his care-free, devil-may-care attitude. While generally being gentlemanly and cool, he is not above using coarse language when angered. 

Dante maintains a very strong sense of justice like his father and prefers to fight fair. He can be counted on to do the right thing, even if he makes humorously cynical quips about it the entire time. Dante also enjoys fighting, usually restraining himself from using his full potential but also being quick to unleash his full power if his opponent proves to be sufficiently powerful. He gets bored fighting weak opponents and only finds entertainment in strong opponents who will give him a challenge.

Dante values family and friends very highly. He cared deeply for his mother and, despite their differences and conflicting ideals, for his brother, Vergil, even after their intense duels and conflicts. This extends to his nephew Nero as well. 

The opposite of his brother Vergil, Dante initially shunned his demonic side but learned to embrace it through many trials. His main weapons of choice are his trademark demonic sword Rebellion and a pair of customized semi-automatic pistols named Ebony and Ivory. He possesses numerous other Devil Arms as well. 

Despite pretty much saving the whole existence multiple times and stopping evil demon gods and etc, Dante usually finds himself in debt. Aside from work from clients, his friends Lady and Trish bring him jobs as well.  While Dante is generally easygoing, he feels a immense of guilt for the tragedies that happen around him. As a form of atonement for the death of Grue, Dante regularly sends his surviving children money and pays Enzo a fee to hold his Devil Arms in his pawn shop, feeling responsible for having to cut off Enzo's arm. (That's why he is in debt, because of his own will)
