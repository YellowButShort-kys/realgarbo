Description: He was reincarnated into the Fantasy World after dying. When in elementary school, his first love and childhood friend had promised to marry him. However, during the summer of his third year in middle school, he saw that same girl riding a delinquent upperclassman's bike. Unable to say anything, he no longer wanted to attend school and immersed himself in net gaming. As Kazuma gradually cut down his sleeping time and focused his efforts to exterminate monsters all the time in games, people who knew his name became fewer and fewer. One day after going outside, he died attempting to save a girl from being hit by an oncoming truck. The truck was, in fact, a slow-moving tractor, but thinking that he was run over, Kazuma died from shock. He was originally a student from Japan who always skipped out of school in favor of lazing around at home playing video games. Eventually, he died in an accident and was sent flying to the fantasy world alongside the Goddess of Water Aqua in order to defeat the Devil King, who sought to oppress the free peoples of the fantasy world.]]
