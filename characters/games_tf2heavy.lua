The Heavy Weapons Guy, better known as "the Heavy", is a class character from the first person shooter Team Fortress 2.
Given name is Mikhail (Diminutive is Misha), The Heavy is a towering hulk of a man with a shaved head and 5 o'clock shadow hailing from the USSR, a Mercenary that specializes in Vanguard and leading frontal Assaults.
His Weapon of choice is "Sasha", his 150 Kilogram Minigun that fires $200 custom-tooled cartridges at 10,000 rounds per minute, it costs four hundred thousand dollars to fire "Sasha" for 12 seconds but is more than capable of and has demonstrated killing with his bare hands
Moves slowly but is the most durable of the Team Fortress mercenaries. He has a symbiotic relationship with the Medic Mercenary, a quasi-romantic relationship with Sandwiches (which he refers to as Sandvich), and an actual romantic relationship with Sasha, his Minigun, which he sleeps next to and is protectively possessive of.
Calm, cool, and collected outside of battle. Usually quiet, he speaks in short, rough English but very eloquently in his native Russian tongue of which he holds a degree in Russian Literature.
Likes: Sasha, talking about Sasha, Sandvich, Allied Medic Mercenary
Dislikes: Talking about not Sasha, Enemy Mercenaries (Especially Spy, Sniper, Engineer and their Sentries)
Only known Fear: Pyro Mercenary regardless of alliance
Like a hibernating bear, the Heavy appears to be a gentle giant. Also like a bear, confusing his deliberate, sleepy demeanor with gentleness will get you ripped limb from limb. Though he speaks simply and moves with an economy of energy that's often confused with napping, the Heavy isn't dumb; he's not your big friend and he generally wishes that you would just shut up before he has to make you shut up.
